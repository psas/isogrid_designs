# Pathfinder Tank
This tank will be manufactured at LV3.1 scale (6" ID) and used to test the manufacturing process.

## End Cap Options
A good overview of common head types (end caps) can be found here:

Spherical end caps are ideal, flat end caps are the heaviest, but are the easiest to manufacture.
Semi-elliptical end caps are good compromise between weight, size, manufacturability.
